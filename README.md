# sparkify_project

## Installation
The jupyter notebook in this repository can be run with basic anaconda installation. If using miniconda, then installation of jupyter notebook is required. The libraries used are:

1. Python 3
2. Pyspark
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib

## Project Motivation
In this project, I am interested in predicting churn of sparkify music streaming service (dummy service like Spotify) by building machine learning model. The data is provided by Udacity. The dataset contains user information such as gender and users behavior that is recorded as web-events. The data will be explored and to be extracted in which the features will be fed on the machine learning model for the prediction.

Some user behaviors that I looked at: how many songs that the users listened to in average and also per day, how many activities that the users do in 1 session, etc.

Predicting churn rate is both challenging and interesting. It is crucial in a company to have this prediction in order to maximize their engagement rate. Thus it is important to have a accurate model in predicting churn. 

## File Descriptions
1. `sparkify.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code that is being used for EDA, feature engineering, and modelling.
2. `sparkify.html`: The HTML version of the above
